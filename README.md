Basic workflow

* **Identify Area of Interest**
* **Model the Ellipsoid Heights** Ellipsoid surface model and gridded point model for area
* **Build Ellipsoid Height grid** Same as above, these two can be combined
* **Create design points** (that you will fit a projection to.) using step 2, and 3 tools
* **Optimize Projections** (running python tools)
* **Evaluate Projections** (more python tools), view results in a GIS
* **Define Zone extents** (draft polyline of where it works, will edit them together in the end.)
