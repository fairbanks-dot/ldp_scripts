* Identify Area of Interest
* Get Ellipsoid surface model and gridded point model for area
* Same as above, these two can be combined
* Create design points (that you will fit a projection to.) using step 2, and 3 tools
* Optimize Projections (running python tools)
* Evaluate Projections (more python tools), view results in a GIS
* Define Zone extents (draft polyline of where it works, will edit them together in the end.)
